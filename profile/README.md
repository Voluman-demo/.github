# Voluman - Volunteer Management System
## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Threats such as floods, pandemics, or war-induced migrations require quick and effective responses from communities around the world. The outbreak of **COVID-19** and the migration of **Ukrainians** resulting from the Russian invasion are two spectacular examples. In moments like these, the help of volunteers is difficult to overestimate. 

Organizing volunteer work is a challenging taskâ€”especially as the number of volunteers increases. A volunteer is not an employee, so the organization must adjust its schedules to match the volunteersâ€™ availability. Additionally:
- **Overstaffing** campaigns can be demotivating for volunteers.
- **Understaffing** leads to overworked volunteers, reducing the quality of services.

### The Problem
Supporting volunteer leaders in managing campaigns is essential. Unfortunately, there is a lack of appropriate IT tools for these processes. In many organizations, leaders rely on:
- Telephones
- Text messages
- Spreadsheets

While these tools may suffice for small numbers of volunteers, they become **ineffective** as the numbers grow.

### The Solution: Voluman
To address this issue, a student team at the **Poznan University of Technology** initiated the development of a **volunteer management system**. The system was designed to:
- Support **planning duty hours** and handling inevitable changes.
- Manage volunteer **applications** and the **acceptance/rejection** process.
- Facilitate **promotions** and **demotions** of volunteers and leaders.
- Oversee the **removal** of volunteers from the system.

### The Challenge
Unfortunately, the original system was not reliable enough for deployment. The aim of this project is to **redesign the server-side architecture** to ensure stability, scalability, and efficiency.

We believe that with the right tools, we can make volunteering **easier, more effective, and more impactful**.
