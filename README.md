  Threats such as floods, pandemics, or war-induced migrations require quick and effective responses from commu-
nities around the world. The outbreak of COVID-19 and the migration of Ukrainians resulting from the Russian
invasion are two spectacular examples. In moments like these, the help of volunteers is difficult to overestimate.
  Organizing volunteer work is a difficult task; the more difficult, the larger the number of volunteers. A volunteer
is not an employee, so the organization must adjust its schedules to the volunteersâ€™ capabilities. In addition,
assigning too many volunteers to a given campaign can be demotivating, and with too few volunteers, they will
be overworked and the quality of services will suffer. Therefore, it is important to support volunteer leaders in
managing campaigns. Unfortunately, there is a lack of appropriate IT tools that could support these processes.
In many organizations, the only tools that leaders have are telephones, text messages, and spreadsheets. With a
small number of volunteers, this may be enough, but when the number of volunteers is large, such tools become
ineffective.
  To help with this, a student team at the Poznan University of Technology launched a project to create a volunteer
management system that would support planning duty hours and tracking inevitable changes to them, including
managing volunteer applications, handling candidate acceptance and rejection, facilitating promotions and demo-
tions of volunteers and leaders, and overseeing the removal of volunteers from the system. Unfortunately, the
system was not reliable enough to deploy it. The aim of this project is to redesign the server part of the system.
